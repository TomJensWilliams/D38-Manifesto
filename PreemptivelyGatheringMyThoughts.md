# Preemptively Gathering My Thougths

## Introduction
	In writing this I don't intend, at least initially, to try to convince you of my opion. Rather, I am taking for granted that I am right and that those who disagree with me are wrong, and once I have caught you up to speed I think that it will be evident to you that I am completely correct in making this assumption. One reason that I am doing this is that all too often we become accustomed to seeing things this or that way, and because everything around us seems to be ok we imagine that what we are used to must itself be ok, or at least not too wrong. In light of that, when we encounter something radically different from what we are used to we imagine that it must be quite not-ok, as what we are used to seems ok, so something much different from that must be much different from ok. In that rest of this document I will seek to demonstrate that what would actually be ok, or even good, is something much different from what is the norm here, and I think that in light of that you will begin to see, even without my explaining it, the many things around us which are not ok.
 
 ## A Brief Word On Clocking In
 	This is a very small issue, but I have noticed that each person clocks in at quite different times, starting something like ten minutes before our assigned shift. After clocking in they each do different things, some of those things actually useful and others not useful, or even detremental. The greater part do work on something at least somewhat useful though, that being moving the appliance out of the middle of the racetrack, which I think might be a mistake, but is at least understandable. Unfortunately some people also use time before their assigned shift for other tasks, such as going around to each of the frieght racks and making modifications on their signs with a marker, often in ways that make no difference at all or have a negative effect. While I understand the positive effect that moving the appliances has I would, perhaps with some caution, suggest that be done after the unload, so as to allow for the next point I would like to address to be easier to implement.
