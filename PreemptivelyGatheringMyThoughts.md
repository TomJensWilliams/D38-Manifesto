	In writing this I don't intend, at least initially, to try to convince you of my opion. Rather, I am taking for granted that I am write and that those who disagree with me are wrong, and once I have caught you up to speed I think that it will be evident to you that I am completely correct in making this assumption. One reason that I am doing this is that all to often we become accustomed to seeing things this or that way, and because everything around us seems to be ok we imagine that what we are used to must itself be ok, or atleast not too wrong. In light of that, when we encounter something radically different from what we are used to we imagine that it must be quite not-ok, as what we are used to seems ok, so something much different from that must be much different from ok. In that rest of this document I will seek to demonstrate that what would actually be ok, or even good, is something much different from what is the norm here, and I think that in light of that you will begin to see, even without my explaining it, the many things around us which are not ok.
